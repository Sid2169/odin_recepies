        Chicken Biryaani
    </h1>
    <p>Biryani is a rice dish that originated in India and is now popular all over the world. It is made with rice, meat, spices, and yogurt. The rice is typically basmati rice, which is a long-grain rice that is known for its aroma and flavor. The meat is typically chicken, lamb, or goat, but other meats such as shrimp or fish can also be used. The spices that are used in biryani vary depending on the region, but they typically include turmeric, cumin, coriander, and chili powder. The yogurt is used to marinate the meat and to give the biryani a creamy texture.</p>

    <p>Biryani is thought to have originated in the Mughal Empire, which ruled India from the 16th to the 19th centuries. The Mughal emperors were known for their love of food and they introduced many new dishes to India, including biryani. Biryani quickly became popular among the Mughals and it soon spread to other parts of India.
